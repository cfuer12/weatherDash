# weatherDash
create a usable weather search web browser

Needed to create a weather dashbiard that would display and prompt weather from a called API, from OpenWeatherMap, and display the current and five-day forecast with the called API.
Using an API key, i have then called to the server from OpenWeather using the API to generate the log call so i can gather the needed info for the assignment. I was able to get and generate the info into displaying onto a weather dashboard site that i managed to build using HTML, CSS and JS. 
There is a search function that saves to a local disc so a user can go back and look at weather from previous searches. 
Once searched, the user can display current weather from any city and also display a 5 day forecast showcasing temperature and humidity for the area plus icons as well. 
Managed to create this templeate using help from fellow collegues and some tutor time, despite not being able to display my page clean enough.
